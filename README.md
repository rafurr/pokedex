# Pokémon Pokédex Search

## App's Technology Stack

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

The app uses the following technologies [React Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux), [Redux Saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga), [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), [Material UI](https://github.com/mui/material-ui), [Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass), [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint), [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest), and others

See documentation below for how to start the App.

## App's Documentation

Here is how the app looks when initially started. Use the Search field to enter your favorite Pokémon either by name or id. The Search field will also maintain a history of the Pokémons you have previosly searched for. The evolution chain Pokémons can be clicked on to take you to that Pokémon.

Have fun poking around. And, oh yeah, this is a work in progress so beware the bugs, but who does not like the hunt! Go Pokémon!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
